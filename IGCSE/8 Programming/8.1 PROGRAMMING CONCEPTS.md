## 8.1 PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS

### SECTION 1 | DECLARE AND USE VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS

**What are Variables and Constants?**
Variables are named storage locations in your computer's memory that can hold different values throughout the execution of a program. Think of variables as containers that store information your program can use and modify.

Constants are similar to variables but, once set, their value cannot change throughout the execution of your program. They are the "constants" in your coding equation, like the speed of light in physics.

**Declaring Variables and Constants**
To declare a variable or constant, you specify its type and give it a name. For example, in Python, you can declare a variable by simply typing age = 21. Here, age is a variable that stores the integer value 21.

Declaring a constant in languages like Python involves naming conventions, such as all-uppercase letters with underscores separating words, e.g., MAX_SPEED = 120, because Python does not have a specific syntax for declaring constants.

**Why Use Them?**
Variables and constants make your code:

- Readable | Using meaningful names makes your code easier to understand.

- Maintainable | Easy to update and modify your program.

- Reusable | Allows for the same code to be used with different data.

- Example declaring variables in Pseudocode

  - integer_example ← 5
  - real_example ← 3.14
  - char_example ← 'A'
  - string_example ← "Hello, World"
  - boolean_example ← TRUE

  ### SECTION 2 | UNDERSTAND AND USE THE BASIC DATA TYPES

  Every piece of data in computer programs has a type. The basic data types include:

  - Integer | Whole numbers, e.g., -10, 0, 25.
  - Real | Numbers with fractional parts, also known as floating-point numbers, e.g., -3.14, 0.0, 2.72.
  - Char |A single character, like 'a', 'B', or '3'.
  - String | A sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello, world!".
  - Boolean | Represents truth values, typically True or False. A Boolean can only be1 of a maximum of 2 values - True/False, On/Off, 1/0, Yes/No

  Choosing the Right Data Type
  Selecting the appropriate data type is crucial for:

  - Efficiency | Using the correct type makes your program run faster and use memory more efficiently.
  - Accuracy | Ensures that the data is represented in a way that makes sense for the intended operation.

  ### SECTION 3 | UNDERSTAND AND USE INPUT AND OUTPUT

  Input is how you get data from the user into your program. It can come from various sources like a keyboard, a file, or button press.

```python
#INPUT Example - Asking a user for their age and storing it in a variable.

age = input("Enter your age: ")

#OUTPUT Example - Displaying a user's age.
print("Your age is", age)
```

```pseudocode
OUTPUT "Enter your age: "
INPUT age
OUTPUT "Your age is ", age
```

Importance of Input and Output

- Interaction | Allows your program to interact with users, making it dynamic and responsive.
- Data Processing | Enables your program to process user-provided data and produce results.

### SECTION 4 | UNDERSTAND AND USE THE CONCEPT OF SEQUENCE

Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of subroutines, block structures, for loops, and if/else decision-making structures. This section covers two fundamental concepts: sequence and selection.

A **sequence** in programming refers to the execution of instructions in the order they are written - from top to bottom in a script. This linear progression makes understanding the flow of a program straightforward.

```python
# Sequence Example
print("Start Program")
age = 20
age = age + 1
print("Age next year:", age)
print("End Program")
```

```pseudocode
// Sequence Example
OUTPUT "Start Program"
age ← 20
age ← age + 1
OUTPUT "Age next year: ", age
OUTPUT "End Program"
```

### SECTION 4 | UNDERSTAND AND USE THE CONCEPT OF SELECTION

Selection uses conditions to decide which pieces of code to execute. This decision-making process allows programs to take different actions based on inputs or other conditions. This examination board generally uses two different methods of selection, the 'IF' statement and the 'CASE' statement.

**IF STATEMENTS**
Usage:

- IF statements are used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. They can also include else and elif (else if) clauses to handle multiple conditions and outcomes.
- Ideal for complex conditions that involve logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) or comparisons that are not solely based on a single variable's value.
- Well-suited for scenarios where the conditions for decision-making are not exhaustive or cannot be easily enumerated.

Characteristics:

- Flexibility in evaluating conditions that can be expressions involving variables, function calls, and logical operations.
- Can become cumbersome or less readable with many elif clauses, making code harder to follow.
- Directly supports execution of alternative blocks of code (else clause).

```python
# IF Statement Example
score = 75
if score >= 50:
    print("You passed!")
else:
    print("Try again!")
```

```pseudocode
// IF Statement Example
score ← 75
IF score >= 50 THEN
    OUTPUT "You passed!"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Try again!"
ENDIF
```

**CASE STATEMENTS** (or Match Statements in Python 3.10+)
Usage

- Used to select one of many blocks of code to execute, based on the value of a single variable.
- Ideal for when you have a variable that can take one out of a small set of possible values and you want to execute different code for each value.
- Makes code cleaner and more readable when dealing with multiple discrete values that a single variable can take.

Characteristics

- More readable and concise for enumerated conditions (e.g., days of the week, specific known values).
- Cannot directly handle complex conditions involving logical operators across multiple variables without additional nesting or checks.
- Python's match statement supports pattern matching, which is more powerful than traditional CASE statements, allowing for matching types, sequences, and more.

```python
number = 2    
match number:
        case 1:
            print "One"
        case 2:
            print "Two"
        case _:
           print "Something else"
```

```pseudocode
// CASE Statement Example
day_number ← 3
CASE OF day_number
    1: day ← "Monday"
    2: day ← "Tuesday"
    3: day ← "Wednesday"
    OTHERWISE: day ← "Unknown"
ENDCASE
OUTPUT "Day is: ", day
```

**DIFFERENCES**

- Complexity of Conditions | IF statements are better for complex logical conditions, whereas CASE (or match) statements are ideal for checking one variable against a series of values.
- Readability | CASE statements can enhance readability when dealing with a clear enumeration of simple conditions. IF statements can become unwieldy with too many elif clauses but offer more flexibility in condition evaluation.
- Use Cases | Use IF statements when conditions are varied and involve multiple variables or complex logic. Use CASE statements for simpler, value-based decision paths on a single variable.

Example - The below statement the below statement compares if the temperature is greater than 30, or less then 10, the else part of the statement would be used if it was any other value:

temperature = 30
if temperature > 30:
  print("It's hot outside.")
elif temperature < 10:
  print("It's cold outside.")
else:
  print("It's nice outside.")

Example - The below statement the below statement compares if the status_code is exactly one of the values stated.

status_code = 404
match status_code:
  case 200:
    print("Success!")
  case 404:
    print("Not Found.")
  case _:
    print("Some other error.")
​
The choice between IF and CASE statements largely depends on the specific needs of your code, the complexity of the conditions you're evaluating, and the need for readability and maintainability of your code. Python's match statement adds extra versatility to the traditional concept of CASE statements, bridging some gaps between these two control flow mechanisms

### SECTION 5 | UNDERSTAND AND USE THE CONCEPT OF ITERATION

Iteration in programming refers to the repetition of a block of code as long as a specified condition is met. It's a fundamental concept that enables programs to perform tasks multiple times efficiently. There are three main types of loops used to implement iteration: count-controlled loops, pre-condition loops, and post-condition loops.

**Count-Controlled Loops**
Usage
Count-controlled loops repeat a block of code a specific number of times. They are often used when the exact number of iterations is known ahead of time, such as processing each item in a fixed-size collection.

```python
# Looping through a range of numbers
for i in range(5):  # Repeats 5 times, from 0 to 4
    print("This is count-controlled loop iteration", i)
```

```pseudocode
FOR i ← 0 TO 4
    OUTPUT "This is count-controlled loop iteration ", i
NEXT i
```

**Pre-Condition Loops**
Usage
Pre-condition loops (while loops) execute a block of code as long as a pre-defined condition is true. They are suitable when the number of iterations is not known before the loop starts, such as reading until an end-of-file marker is found.

```python
# Looping until a condition is met
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("This is pre-condition loop iteration", count)
    count += 1
```

```pseudocode
count ← 0
WHILE count < 5 DO
    OUTPUT "This is pre-condition loop iteration ", count
    count ← count + 1
ENDWHILE
```

**Post-Condition Loops**
Usage
Post-condition loops execute the loop body first and then check the condition to decide whether to continue. They guarantee that the loop body is executed at least once. This is useful in scenarios where the loop must execute at least once, such as displaying a menu and processing user input.

Python Example:
Python does not have a built-in post-condition loop construct, but you can mimic its behaviour using a while loop.

```python
# Simulating a post-condition loop
condition = False
while True:
    print("This loop runs at least once.")
    condition = input("Continue? (yes/no): ") != "yes"
    if condition:
        break
```

```pseudocode
REPEAT
    OUTPUT "This loop runs at least once."
    INPUT condition, "Continue? (yes/no): "
UNTIL condition ≠ "yes"
```

Iterations are a powerful concept in programming, allowing for efficient repetition of code blocks. Count-controlled loops are ideal for a known number of iterations, pre-condition loops for uncertain iterations determined by conditions evaluated before entering the loop, and post-condition loops for scenarios where at least one iteration is required, with further iterations dependent on a condition checked after the loop's body executes

| LOOP TYPE            | DESCRIPTION                                                  | USE CASE                                                     | PYTHON                   | PSEUDOCODE                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Count-Controlled** | Iterates a specific number of times.                         | When the number of iterations is known ahead of time         | for i in range(5):       | FOR i ← 0 TO 4             |
| **Pre-Condition**    | Continues as long as a condition is true.                    | When the number of iterations is not known before the loop starts. | while condition:         | WHILE condition DO         |
| **Post-Condition**   | Executes at least once, then continues based on a condition. | When the loop must run at least once and then continue based on a condition evaluated after each iteration. | while True: with a break | REPEAT ... UNTIL condition |

This table highlights the key characteristics and use cases for each loop type, along with examples in both Python and the CIE pseudocode syntax.

### SECTION 6 | UNDERSTAND AND USE THE CONCEPTS OF TOTALLING AND COUNTING

In programming, "totalling" and "counting" are fundamental concepts used to aggregate or summarize data. "Totalling" involves summing up numbers to obtain a total, while "counting" refers to incrementally increasing a counter to track the quantity of items or occurrences. These concepts are crucial for data analysis, reporting, and decision-making processes in software applications.

**Totalling**
Totalling is the process of accumulating a sum over a set of numbers. This is commonly used in scenarios where you need to calculate the total score, the total amount of sales, or any other cumulative metric.

```python
# Calculating the total of a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
total = 0
for number in numbers:
    total += number
print("Total is:", total)
```

```pseudocode
numbers: ARRAY[1:4] OF INTEGER = [10, 20, 30, 40]
total ← 0
FOR i ← 1 TO 4
    total ← total + numbers[i]
ENDFOR
OUTPUT "Total is: ", total
```

**Counting**
Counting involves incrementally updating a counter to track the number of occurrences of an event, such as counting the number of items that meet a specific condition.

```python
# Counting the number of even numbers in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
count = 0
for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        count += 1
print("Count of even numbers is:", count)
```

```pseudocode
numbers: ARRAY[1:6] OF INTEGER = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
count ← 0
FOR i ← 1 TO 6
    IF numbers[i] MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        count ← count + 1
    ENDIF
ENDFOR
OUTPUT "Count of even numbers is: ", count
```

**Differences and Use Cases**
Totalling is used when you need to accumulate a numeric value, such as calculating the sum of all elements in a list. It is often used in financial applications, statistical calculations, and anywhere you need to aggregate numeric data.

Counting is used to determine the quantity of items that meet a specific criterion. This is useful in scenarios where you need to track occurrences, such as counting the number of passing grades, the number of positive reviews, or any condition-based metric.

Both concepts are essential for data processing and analysis, enabling programmers to derive meaningful insights and metrics from data sets. Understanding how to implement totalling and counting effectively can greatly enhance a program's ability to process and summarize data.



### SECTION 7 | UNDERSTAND AND USE THE CONCEPT OF STRING HANDLING

String handling involves manipulating text data in various ways, such as searching for substrings, converting between uppercase and lowercase, and extracting parts of strings. Effective string handling is crucial for data processing, user input manipulation, and many other programming tasks.

Basic String Operations

- Length | Determine the length of a string.
- Substring | Extract a portion of a string.
- Concatenation | Join two or more strings together.
- Conversion | Change the case of a string (e.g., to uppercase or lowercase).
- Comparison |Compare two strings for equality or lexical order.

Python Examples and Corresponding Pseudocode (CIE)



```python
#LENGTH
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(len(my_string))

#SUBSTRING
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string[7:12])  
#The output would be 'World'

#CONCATENATION
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"
message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
print(message)

#CONVERSION
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string.upper())
print(my_string.lower())

#COMPARISION
string1 = "hello"
string2 = "world"
print(string1 == string2)  # False
```

```pseudocode
#LENGTH
myString ← "Hello, World!"
OUTPUT LENGTH(myString)

#SUBSTRING
myString ← "Hello, World!"
OUTPUT myString[7:12]
#The output would be 'World'

#CONCATENATION
greeting ← "Hello"
name ← "Alice"
message ← greeting + ", " + name + "!"
OUTPUT message

#CONVERSION
myString ← "Hello, World!"
OUTPUT TOUPPERCASE(myString)
OUTPUT TOLOWERCASE(myString)​

#COMPARISION
string1 ← "hello"
string2 ← "world"
IF string1 = string2 THEN
    OUTPUT "True"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "False"
ENDIF
```

String handling is a powerful tool in programming, enabling the manipulation and analysis of textual data. Understanding these basic operations—length, substring extraction, concatenation, conversion, and comparison—is essential for processing and utilising strings effectively in any programming task. The examples provided in both Python and pseudocode demonstrate how these operations can be implemented, showcasing the versatility and necessity of string handling in programming.
