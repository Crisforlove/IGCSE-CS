## 8.3 | FILE HANDLING

### SECTION 1 | WHAT IS FILE HANDLING

File handling refers to the process by which a computer program interacts with files stored on a disk, enabling the reading, writing, and modification of data. Unlike data stored in standard arrays, which are temporary and reset every time a program restarts, files provide a way to preserve data persistently across multiple runs of an application. This is crucial for applications that require long-term data storage, such as user settings, game scores, or transaction logs.

In programming languages like Python, file handling is straightforward yet powerful. Python uses simple commands to open, read, write, and close files, making it an ideal learning tool for students transitioning from temporary data storage in arrays to more permanent solutions. For example, to write data to a file, a Python program might open a file in write mode ('w'), write strings directly to the file, and then close it to ensure the data is saved:

```python
with open('data.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Have a great day.')
```

```pseudocode
DECLARE DataToStore : STRING
DataToStore ← "Have a great day."

OPENFILE "data.txt" FOR WRITE
WRITEFILE "data.txt", DataToStore
CLOSEFILE "data.txt"
```

This code snippet opens data.txt (or creates it if it doesn't exist), writes a line of text, and automatically closes the file when done. The use of files allows data to be retained after the program closes, providing a durable means of storing information that can be retrieved and manipulated in subsequent program executions. This concept of persistent storage is fundamental for developing applications that interact with user data or require the retention of operational data over time.

### SECTION 2 | READING FROM A TEXT FILE

To read data from a file, you must first open it in READ mode. Once opened, you can read the data using:

```python
# Open the file "data.txt" in read mode and read from it
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    my_data = file.read()

# Output the data read from the file
print(my_data)
```

```pseudocode
DECLARE MyData : STRING
OPENFILE "data.txt" FOR READ
READFILE "data.txt", MyData
CLOSEFILE "data.txt"
```

SECTION 3 | WRITING TO A TEXT FILE

To write data to a file, open it in WRITE mode. Any existing content in the file will be erased. To write, use:

```python
# Open the file "output.txt" in write mode and write to it
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")
```

```pseudocode
DECLARE MyData : STRING
MyData ← "Hello, world!"
OPENFILE "output.txt" FOR WRITE
WRITEFILE "output.txt", MyData
CLOSEFILE "output.txt"
```

### SECTION 4 | CLOSING A FILE

After completing the read or write operations, it is good practice to close the file:

```pseudocode
CLOSEFILE "output.txt"
```

### SECTION 5 | COPYING TEXT BETWEEN FILES

Consider a scenario where you need to copy a line of text from one file to another:

```python
# Open "FileA.txt" for reading
with open("FileA.txt", "r") as file_a:
    line_of_text = file_a.read()  # Read all content from FileA

# Open "FileB.txt" for writing
with open("FileB.txt", "w") as file_b:
    file_b.write(line_of_text)  # Write the content to FileB
```

```pseudocode
DECLARE LineOfText : STRING
OPENFILE "FileA.txt" FOR READ
OPENFILE "FileB.txt" FOR WRITE
READFILE "FileA.txt", LineOfText
WRITEFILE "FileB.txt", LineOfText
CLOSEFILE "FileA.txt"
CLOSEFILE "FileB.txt"
```

### SECTION 6 | READ/WRITE - WORD, LINE, DOCUMENT

Here, we explore the concepts of reading and writing by word, by line, and by the entire document, and how these operations are typically implemented in programming.

**Reading and Writing a Word**
When you read or write a word from a file, you are typically interacting with the smallest unit of meaningful text separated by spaces or punctuation. This level of granularity is useful for text analysis, such as counting word frequency or replacing specific words.

**READING A WORD**

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    words = file.read().split()  # This reads the entire content and splits it by whitespace
    for word in words:
        print(word)  # This prints each word separately
```

```pseudocode
OPENFILE "file.txt" FOR READ
DECLARE words : LIST OF STRING
READFILE "file.txt", words  // Assuming the entire file is read and split into words
FOR EACH word IN words
    OUTPUT word
ENDFOR
CLOSEFILE "file.txt"
```

**WRITING A WORD**

```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    word = "Hello"
    file.write(word + " ")  # Writes a single word to the file, followed by a space
```

```pseudocode
DECLARE word : STRING
word ← "Hello"
OPENFILE "file.txt" FOR WRITE
WRITEFILE "file.txt", word + " "  // Adds a space after the word
CLOSEFILE "file.txt"
```

**Reading and Writing a Line**
Lines represent a sequence of characters ending with a newline character (\n). Handling data line by line is one of the most common forms of file manipulation, used for reading configuration files, logs, or any data structured into rows.

**READING A LINE**

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # `strip` removes the newline character at the end of each line
```

```pseudocode
OPENFILE "file.txt" FOR READ
DECLARE line : STRING
WHILE NOT EOF("file.txt")  // Loop until the end of the file
    READFILE "file.txt", line
    OUTPUT line
ENDWHILE
CLOSEFILE "file.txt"
```

**WRITING A LINE**

```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    line = "This is a line of text\n"
    file.write(line)  # Writes the line including the newline character to delineate lines
```

```pseudocode
DECLARE line : STRING
line ← "This is a line of text\n"
OPENFILE "file.txt" FOR WRITE
WRITEFILE "file.txt", line
CLOSEFILE "file.txt"
```

**Reading and Writing the Entire Document**
Sometimes, it's necessary to work with the entire content of a document at once, such as when loading configuration settings or processing small files where it's efficient to work with all the data in memory.

**READING THE DOCUMENT**

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()  # Reads the entire file into a single string
    print(content)
```

```pseudocode
OPENFILE "file.txt" FOR READ
DECLARE content : STRING
READFILE "file.txt", content  // Reads the entire file into 'content'
OUTPUT content
CLOSEFILE "file.txt"
```

**WRITING THE DOCUMENT**

```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    content = "This is the entire content of the file."
    file.write(content)  # Writes a large block of text to the file
```

```pseudocode
DECLARE content : STRING
content ← "This is the entire content of the file."
OPENFILE "file.txt" FOR WRITE
WRITEFILE "file.txt", content
CLOSEFILE "file.txt"
```

### SECTION 7 | FILE HANDLING WITH SPREADSHEETS / CSV FILES

CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are commonly used to store tabular data. These files are straightforward to read from and write to because their data is separated by commas, making parsing simple. In computer programming, handling CSV files efficiently can be crucial for data processing tasks such as database uploads, data analysis, and report generation. Here, we'll explore how to perform basic operations such as reading, writing, appending, and modifying data in CSV files.

**READING FROM A CSV FILE**

```python
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'r', newline='') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)  # Each row is a list of values
```

```pseudocode
OPENFILE "data.csv" FOR READ
DECLARE row : STRING
WHILE NOT EOF("data.csv")
    READFILE "data.csv", row
    OUTPUT row  // Prints each row of the CSV file
ENDWHILE
CLOSEFILE "data.csv"
```

**WRITING TO A CSV FILE**

```python
import csv

with open('new_data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Name', 'Age', 'Location'])  # Write a header row
```

```pseudocode
OPENFILE "new_data.csv" FOR WRITE
DECLARE dataRow : STRING
dataRow ← "Name,Age,Location"
WRITEFILE "new_data.csv", dataRow
CLOSEFILE "new_data.csv"
```

**APPENDING A CSV FILE**

Appending to a CSV file involves adding new rows of data without overwriting existing data.

```python
OPENFILE "data.csv" FOR APPEND
DECLARE newRow : STRING
newRow ← "John,30,New York"
WRITEFILE "data.csv", newRow
CLOSEFILE "data.csv"
```

```pseudocode
import csv

with open('data.csv', 'a', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['John', 30, 'New York'])  # Append a new row
```

**MODIFYING A CSV FILE**

Modifying a CSV file generally involves reading the existing data, making changes, and then writing the data back to the file.

```python
import csv

# Read all data
data = []
with open('data.csv', 'r', newline='') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        data.append(row)

# Modify data
for row in data:
    if 'OldLocation' in row:
        index = row.index('OldLocation')
        row[index] = 'NewLocation'

# Write data back
with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    for row in data:
        writer.writerow(row)
```

```pseudocode
import csv

# Read all data
data = []
with open('data.csv', 'r', newline='') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        data.append(row)

# Modify data
for row in data:
    if 'OldLocation' in row:
        index = row.index('OldLocation')
        row[index] = 'NewLocation'

# Write data back
with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    for row in data:
        writer.writerow(row)
```
