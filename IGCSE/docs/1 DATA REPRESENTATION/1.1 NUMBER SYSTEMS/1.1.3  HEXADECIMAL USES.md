## 1.1.3 | HEXADECIMAL USES

**OBJECTIVES**

1.1.3 Understand how and why hexadecimal is used as a beneficial method of data representation

### SECTION 1 | HOW IS HEXADECIMAL USED IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS

Hexadecimal (HEX) is a beneficial method of data representation for several reasons. Firstly, it is a more compact notation than binary for representing large numbers. Each digit in a HEX number represents 4 bits, which is more concise than the 8 bits required for each digit in binary. This makes HEX an efficient way to represent large amounts of data, particularly in for easy human interpretation.

- HEX is a widely recognized notation in digital systems, making it easier to communicate and interpret data across different systems and applications. Many devices and systems use HEX notation to display and transmit data, particularly in computer networking and telecommunications.
- HEX is easier for humans to read than binary, since HEX numbers can be represented using a smaller number of digits than binary numbers. This makes it easier to interpret and work with HEX data, particularly for non-technical users who may not be familiar with binary notation.
- HEX takes up less screen space than binary, which means it can be used on small displays such as washing machines to give error codes or other status information. HEX allows for concise, easy-to-read displays that can be used in a variety of applications and devices, making it a valuable tool for data representation in digital systems.

Hexadecimal (HEX) is used in several areas within a computer system, including:

- **Memory Addressing:** Computer memory is typically organized as a series of individual addressable locations, each of which contains a binary value. These memory locations are often represented using HEX notation, which makes it easier for programmers and system administrators to work with large amounts of memory data.
- **Programming:** Many programming languages and development tools use HEX notation to represent binary values, such as machine instructions or memory addresses. HEX provides a more compact and convenient way to work with binary data in programming environments.
- **Error Codes:** In many computer systems, error codes are used to indicate specific system or software errors. These error codes are often displayed using HEX notation, which provides a concise and easy-to-read way to communicate complex error information to users.
- **Network Addresses:** In computer networking, HEX notation is often used to represent IP addresses and other network addresses. This allows network administrators to easily interpret and work with network addressing data in a concise and standardized format.
- **Graphics:** In computer graphics, HEX notation is used to represent colours using the RGB (Red-Green-Blue) colour model. Each colour component is represented using a 2-digit HEX number, allowing for precise and efficient representation of colour data.

HEX is used in several important areas within a computer system, providing a valuable tool for representing and working with binary and other data in a standardized and efficient manner

### SECTION 2 | HEXADECIMAL COLOUR REPRESENTATION

Just as numbers and letters are represented with Binary, so are images. To a computer an image is nothing more than a series of ones and zeros which allow the display of pixels in various colours.

To aid human reading of different colour codes, colours are commonly represented in Hexadecimal using the RGB Red Green Blue system. For example the chart below shows how pure blue is represented using HEX, the HEX code for pure blue is #00 00 FF, meaning it has zero red components, zero green components and the maximum amount of Blue components.

A brief colour chart for some of the colours represented in hexadecimal.

Most software that allows you to manipulate images or colours will allow you to select colours by their HEX or RGB values.

**Remember:** Hex is used for our benefit to make it easy for use to see and work with, but the computer still deals with colour in binary format



**TERMINOLOGY**

**Hexadecimal (HEX)**

A base-16 number system used in computing for a compact representation of binary data. HEX digits range from 0 to F, where each digit represents four binary bits.

**Binary**

A base-2 number system that uses only 0 and 1, representing the fundamental language of computers.

**Memory Addressing**

A method of organizing and accessing specific memory locations in a computer. Memory addresses are often represented in hexadecimal for readability, especially when working with large datasets.

**Programming**

The process of creating and managing instructions that computers follow. Hexadecimal is frequently used in programming to represent binary data more compactly, such as in memory addresses or machine instructions.

**Error Codes**

Identifiers used to signal specific errors in a computer system. Hexadecimal is often used to represent error codes, providing a standardized way to convey complex information in a compact format.

**Network Addressing**

The system of assigning addresses to devices on a network. HEX is commonly used for IP addresses and other network addresses, offering an easy-to-read, standardized format for network management.

**RGB (Red-Green-Blue)**

A color model where colors are represented through varying intensities of red, green, and blue. Each component is typically shown as a 2-digit hexadecimal value, providing a precise representation of colors for computer graphics.

**HEX Color Code**

A 6-digit code used in web design and graphics to define colors, where the first two digits represent red, the next two represent green, and the last two represent blue (e.g., #0000FF for pure blue).

**Pixel**

The smallest unit in a digital image, often represented in binary by color values. Each pixelâ€™s color is defined using the RGB model, commonly represented in hexadecimal to simplify human interpretation.

**Data Representation**

The methods by which various types of data are encoded for storage or processing in computers. HEX is one method of representation, particularly useful for displaying large binary numbers in a concise, human-readable form.

**Compact Notation**

A simplified way of displaying data. In computing, HEX is preferred over binary for its compactness, as it takes fewer digits to represent large binary numbers.
