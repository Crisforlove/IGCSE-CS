## 1.1.5 | BINARY SHIFT

**OBJECTIVES**
1.1.5 Perform a logical binary shift on a positive 8-bit binary integer and understand the effect this has on the positive binary integer



WHAT IS A BINARY SHIFT

Performing a logical binary shift on a positive 8-bit binary integer involves shifting all the bits in the binary number to the left or right by a specified number of positions. The shift can be either a left shift, which involves moving all the bits to the left and adding 0's on the right, or a right shift, which involves moving all the bits to the right and adding 0's on the left.

The effect of a logical binary shift on a positive binary integer depends on the direction and the number of bit positions being shifted. In a left shift, the value of the binary number is effectively multiplied by 2 to the power of the number of bit positions being shifted. This is because each bit in the binary number represents a power of 2, and shifting the bits to the left increases the value of the number by a factor of 2. Conversely, in a right shift, the value of the binary number is effectively divided by 2 to the power of the number of bit positions being shifted. This is because shifting the bits to the right decreases the value of the number by a factor of 2.

For example, let's consider the binary number 00011010. If we perform a left shift by 2 positions, we get 01101000. This is equivalent to multiplying the original value (26 in denary) by 2^2, which gives us 104 in denary. On the other hand, if we perform a right shift by 3 positions, we get 00000011. This is equivalent to dividing the original value (26 in denary) by 2^3, which gives us 3 in denary.

This operation is commonly used in digital systems and programming languages to perform efficient arithmetic and data manipulation operations on binary data.

HOW TO PERFORM A BINARY SHIFT

Here are two example tables showing the the process of a binary shift and the outcome of each.

Table 2: After Logical Binary Shift (Left Shift by 2 Positions)

In this example, we have a binary number represented in an 8-bit format with the values of each bit position indicated in the column headers. The original binary number is 10110010 (178 in denary), which is represented in the first row of Table 1. We want to perform a left shift by 2 positions, which involves moving all the bits to the left and adding 0's on the right. The resulting binary number is 11001000 (200 in denary), which is represented in the first row of Table 2.

Table 4: After Logical Binary Shift (Right Shift by 3 Positions)

In this example, we have the same binary number represented in Table 3, which is 10110010 (178 in denary). We want to perform a right shift by 3 positions, which involves moving all the bits to the right and adding 0's on the left. The resulting binary number is 00001011 (11 in denary), which is represented in the first row of Table 4.



**TERMINOLOGY**

**Binary |** A base-2 number system used in computing that includes only two digits: 0 and 1.

**Bit |** The smallest unit of data in computing, represented as either 0 or 1.

**Binary Shift |** A method of moving the positions of binary digits either to the left or right, affecting the value of the binary number.

**Left Shift |** A binary shift where each digit is moved one or more places to the left, effectively multiplying the binary number by 2 for each place shifted.

**Right Shift |** A binary shift where each digit is moved one or more places to the right, effectively dividing the binary number by 2 for each place shifted.

**Place Value |** The value of a position in a binary number, each representing a power of 2, increasing from right to left.

**Multiplication by Powers of 2 |** The effect of a left shift, where the value of a binary number doubles with each left shift position.

**Division by Powers of 2 |** The effect of a right shift, where the value of a binary number halves with each right shift position.

**Padding |** The process of adding zeros to the right (in a left shift) or to the left (in a right shift) to maintain the binary structure after shifting.

**Overflow in Shifting |** Occurs when a left shift pushes bits beyond the registerâ€™s capacity, causing data to be lost.

**Logical Shift |** A type of binary shift that simply moves all bits left or right and inserts a 0 at the vacant positions, with no consideration for the sign of the number.

**Arithmetic Shift |** A binary shift typically used with signed numbers; it shifts the bits while maintaining the sign bit (the leftmost bit) in a right shift.
