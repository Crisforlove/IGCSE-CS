## 1.1.2 BINARY, HEX AND CONVERTIG BETWEEN NUMBER SYSTEMS

**OBJECTIVES**
**1.1.2 (a) Understand the denary, binary and hexadecimal number systems**

• Denary is a base 10 system

• Binary is a base 2 system

• Hexadecimal is a base 16 system

**1.1.2(b) Convert between (i) positive denary and positive binary (ii) positive denary and positive hexadecimal (iii) positive hexadecimal and positive binary**

• Values used will be integers only

• Conversions in both directions, e.g. denary to binary or binary to denary

• Maximum binary number length of 16-bit



Understanding different number systems is crucial in computer science. This section covers the basics of denary, binary, and hexadecimal systems. Denary, or decimal, is the base 10 system we use daily. Binary is the base 2 system, essential for computer operations, using only digits 0 and 1. Hexadecimal is a base 16 system, utilising digits 0-9 and letters A-F. You'll learn to convert between positive denary and binary, denary and hexadecimal, and hexadecimal and binary, focusing on integer values and a maximum 16-bit binary length.

**Denary System (Base 10)**

- Denary, or decimal, is our everyday number system.
- It uses 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Each digit's position represents a power of 10.

**Binary System (Base 2)**

- Binary is used in computers and digital systems.
- It uses only two digits: 0 and 1.
- Each digit's position represents a power of 2.

**Hexadecimal System (Base 16)**

- Hexadecimal is often used in computing where compact representation is needed.
- It uses 16 symbols: 0-9 and A-F (where A=10, B=11, ..., F=15).
- Each digit's position represents a power of 16.

## SECTION 1 | BINARY NUMBERS

The number system we all know has Units, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands and so on, we call this traditional number system the **Denary** number system. The binary number system is different, it has 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s and so on. The denery number system is the system you learn in maths and is a base 10 system, the Binary system however, is a base 2 system, this means in Binary that only one of two possible values can go in each column heading, a zero or a one. These ones and zeros are called **BITs.**

Like in traditional math if you take the value from each column and multiply it by the column header you get the total value of the number. In the example above, to the left we have (1 x 32) + (1 x 8) + (1 x 4) = 44

So **Binary 00101100 is equivalent to Denary 44**
Note: If the right most (the least significant) binary digit is a 1 then binary value must be representing an odd number.

Eight BITs make a **Byte**, for example 10101010 is a byte. The examinations papers frequently use bytes, however for this course you need to be able to work with up to 16 BITs and calculators are not allowed.

With 16 bits we could uniquely represent 2^16 (65536) different values, which is close to enough to encode every letter, number and character of every language.



**TERMINOLOGY**

**Denary (Decimal)**

- **Definition:** The base-10 number system used in everyday mathematics.
- **Example:** 42 in denary represents four tens and two ones.

**Binary**

- **Definition:** The base-2 number system used in computing and digital electronics. 
- **Example:** 1011 in binary represents one eight, zero fours, one two, and one one.

- **Bit |**The smallest unit of data in a computer, representing a binary digit (0 or 1).
- **Nibble |** A group of four binary digits (bits) or half a byte.
- **Byte |** A unit of digital information consisting of eight bits, commonly used to represent characters.

**Hexadecimal**

- **Definition:** The base-16 number system often used in computing for compact representation.
- **Example:** 1F in hexadecimal represents one sixteen and fifteen ones.
