## 1.1.1 WHY COMPUTERS USE BINARY

**OBJECTIVES**
​**​1.1.1 Understand how and why computers use binary to represent all forms of data.**

- Any form of data needs to be converted to binary to be processed by a computer
- Data is processed using logic gates and stored in registers



Whilst computer are complex machines that are capable of a countless number of functions at an incomprehensible speed, when they are broken down to their most simple form, they are little more complex than a light switch. Imagine if you had just two light switches and represented a letter with each combination of the switch settings, you could represent 4 different letters.

When you press a key on your keyboard an electrical signal is sent to your computer and converted to a binary representation, a combination of switches being on or off. To make it easy for visual representation we represent the OFF state with zeros and the ON state with ones. For example, when you press the letter A on your keyboard the electrical signal is converted and stored as 01000001, the letter B is stored as 01000010.

Whilst at its core the computer is no more complicated than a light switch, when you combine billions of light switches with the hundreds of thousands of components that create your computer, impressive things can be done.

Every keystroke, pixel on your screen, image you upload, sound played by your computer is all converted to a binary representation to be stored and processed on your computer.

Every process your computer does can be broken down to its binary representation, the processor can process billions of operations per second and each binary value is stored in a very fast and very small section of memory called a **register** whilst it is waiting to be processed.



**TERMINOLOGY**



**Binary**: A number system that uses only two digits, 0 and 1.
**Logic Gates**: Electronic circuits that perform basic logic functions such as AND, OR, and NOT.
**Registers**: Small, fast storage locations in a computer's CPU that hold data temporarily during processing.
