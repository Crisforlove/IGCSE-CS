## 1.1.4 | BINARY ADDITION AND OVERFLOW

**OBJECTIVES 1.1.4**

**(a) Add two positive 8-bit binary integers**
**(b) Understand the concept of overflow and why it occurs in binary addition**

SECTION 1 | **BINARY ADDITION**

It is simple to just convert a Binary representation to Denary, add the Denary values then convert back to Binary, however Binary addition is also easy if you follow the rules below:

- **Zero plus Zero = 0**
- **Zero plus One = 1**
- **One plus One = 0 and carry a 1**
- **Three Ones = 1 plus carry a 1**

Number 1 = 11
Number 2 = 6
Answer = **18​**

Starting from the right(least significant bit) of the binary

- 1 + 1 = 0 and carry 1 (shown in red in the 2s column)
- 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 and carry 1 (shown in red in the 4s column)
- 1 + 1 = 0 and carry 1 (shown in red in the 8s column)
- 1 + 1 = 0 and carry 1 (shown in red in the 16s column)
- 1 + 0 = 1
- Answer **1 0 0 1 0** which is **18**

Additional Example with Explanation

Let’s try a slightly larger binary addition example.

**Example:** Add **1111** (15 in decimal) and **1001** (9 in decimal).

**1: Write the numbers aligned by column:**

  1111
\+ 1001 

2: **Starting from the rightmost column:**
**1 + 1 = 0** → Write **0** and carry **1**.



**3: Next column:**
**1 + 0 + 1 (carried) = 0** → Write **0** and carry **1**.

**4: Next column:**
**1 + 0 + 1 (carried) = 0** → Write **0** and carry **1**.

**5: Leftmost column:**
**1 + 1 + 1 (carried) = 1** → Write **1** and carry **1** to the next column.
The result is **11000**.

Why Binary Addition is Important
​Binary addition is fundamental in computer systems because it’s the basis for arithmetic operations in digital circuits. Understanding binary addition helps you grasp how computers process data at the most basic level.



What is the result of adding the binary numbers 1011 and 1101?

A) 10010

B) 11100

C) 10100

D) 11000



## SECTION 2 | OVERFLOW

Overflow in binary addition occurs when the result of adding two binary numbers exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the number of bits allocated for the calculation. When this happens, the result cannot be represented accurately within the available bits, and the most significant bit (MSB) of the result is lost or "overflows" beyond the maximum value that can be represented.

To understand this concept, consider adding two 8-bit binary numbers, 11111111 and 00000001. The sum of these two numbers is 1,00000000, but since only 8 bits are allocated for the result, the most significant bit of the sum is lost, resulting in a final answer of 00000000. In this case, overflow has occurred because the sum of the two numbers exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by 8 bits.

Overflow can have serious consequences in computer systems and can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior. To avoid overflow, it is important to ensure that the number of bits allocated for binary calculations is sufficient to represent the expected range of values accurately. If overflow does occur, appropriate error handling mechanisms should be in place to alert the user or take corrective action.



What happens when adding two 8-bit binary numbers results in a value greater than 255?

A) The result is stored as-is in the 8-bit register.

B) The extra bits are ignored, and only the first 8 bits are stored.

C) An overflow error occurs because the result exceeds the 8-bit limit.

D) The result is automatically converted to hexadecimal format.



**TERMINOLOGY**

**Binary |** A base-2 number system used in computing, consisting of only two digits: 0 and 1. It’s the fundamental language of computers.

**Bit |** The smallest unit of data in computing, represented as either 0 or 1. Bits are the building blocks of binary numbers.

**Binary Addition |** The process of adding binary numbers. Follows specific rules, such as 1 + 1 = 10 in binary, where the result is 0 and a carry of 1.

**Carry |** In binary addition, a carry occurs when two 1s are added together. The result is 0 in the current place value, with 1 carried over to the next higher place.

**8-bit Register |** A fixed storage space in a computer’s memory that holds 8 bits, allowing binary numbers up to 8 digits long.

**Overflow |** An error that occurs when the result of a binary addition exceeds the storage limit of a register. In an 8-bit register, overflow happens if the sum exceeds 255.

**Decimal |** A base-10 number system commonly used in everyday life. It includes the digits 0–9 and serves as a familiar reference point when learning binary.

**Base |** The foundation of a number system that indicates how many unique digits are used. Binary is base-2, decimal is base-10, and hexadecimal is base-16.

**Register |** A small, fast storage location within a computer’s CPU used to store binary data temporarily.

**Place Value |** In binary, each position represents a power of 2, with the rightmost place being 2^0, the next being 2^1, and so on.

**Overflow Error |** A specific type of error caused when an arithmetic operation results in a value too large to be represented within the available number of bits.

**Carry Bit |** A bit that is carried to the next column in binary addition, similar to carrying over in decimal addition.

**Bit Limit |**The maximum number of bits that can be used in a particular operation or storage, such as an 8-bit limit in many systems.
