## 1.3.1 | DATA STORAGE MEASUREMENTS

DATA STORAGE MEASUREMENTS

Data storage is measured in units of bytes, with larger units being used to represent larger storage capacities. For example, early computers such as the IBM 650 in the 1950s had a storage capacity of around 2000 characters, or roughly 2 kilobytes (KB) of data. By the 1980s, personal computers such as the Apple II and Commodore 64 had storage capacities of around 64 KB to 128 KB.

Today, modern computer storage devices such as hard disk drives, solid state drives, and USB flash drives have storage capacities that range from a few gigabytes (GB) to multiple terabytes (TB). For example, a typical laptop hard drive might have a capacity of 500 GB, while high-end solid state drives can have capacities of up to 4 TB.

Storage capacity can be represented in different formats, such as megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and so on. However, these units are based on powers of 10, which can lead to confusion when dealing with binary data storage. To address this issue, a binary prefix system was introduced, which uses prefixes such as kibi-, mebi-, gibi-, and tebi- to represent binary multiples of bytes (powers of 2). For example, a kibibyte (KiB) represents 1024 bytes, while a megabyte (MB) represents 1000 bytes.

In summary, data storage is measured in units of bytes, with larger units being used to represent larger storage capacities. Early computers had relatively small storage capacities, while modern computer storage devices can store terabytes of data. Storage capacity can be represented in different formats, and binary prefixes such as kibi- and mebi- are used to represent binary multiples of bytes.

The following data storage notations are listed in order of size and an example use for each is given:

- **Bit:** 1 bit represents a single binary digit, which can be either a 0 or a 1. Bits are used to represent the smallest unit of digital data and are often used in communication protocols and encryption algorithms.
- **Nibble:** A nibble represents 4 bits of data, or half a byte. Nibbles are not commonly used in modern computing, but were used in older systems to represent hexadecimal values.
- **Byte:** A byte represents 8 bits of data and is the basic unit of storage in most computer systems. Bytes are used to represent individual characters, such as letters and numbers, as well as larger data types such as images and audio.
- **Kibibyte (KiB):** 1 KiB represents 1024 bytes of data. KiB is used to represent small to medium-sized files, such as text documents or low-resolution images.
- **Mebibyte (MiB):** 1 MiB represents 1024 KiB, or 1,048,576 bytes of data. MiB is used to represent larger files, such as high-resolution images or short audio clips.
- **Gibibyte (GiB):** 1 GiB represents 1024 MiB, or 1,073,741,824 bytes of data. GiB is used to represent even larger files, such as videos or large software applications.
- **Tebibyte (TiB):** 1 TiB represents 1024 GiB, or 1,099,511,627,776 bytes of data. TiB is used to represent very large files, such as high-resolution videos or large databases.
- **Pebibyte (PiB):** 1 PiB represents 1024 TiB, or 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes of data. PiB is used to represent data storage at the petabyte level, such as in large data centers or cloud storage services.
- **Exbibyte (EiB):** 1 EiB represents 1024 PiB, or 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes of data. EiB is used to represent data storage at the exabyte level, such as in scientific research or big data applications.

A) Bit, Byte, Kilobyte, Gigabyte, Megabyte

B) Bit, Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte

C) Byte, Bit, Megabyte, Kilobyte, Gigabyte

D) Byte, Bit, Kilobyte, Terabyte, Megabyte
