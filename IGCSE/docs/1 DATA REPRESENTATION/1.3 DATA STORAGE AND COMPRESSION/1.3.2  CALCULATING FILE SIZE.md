To calculate the file size of the two images above, firstly although only two colours have been used, lets presume a colour depth of 8 bit for both images.

**Image 1 calculation:**

**Firstly;** calculate the total amount of pixels used in the image

8 pixels wide by 8 pixels tall: 8 x 8 = 64 (A total of 64 pixels used to represent the entire image)

**Secondly;** multiply the total pixels used by the colour depth (8 bits have been used to represent the content of each pixel)

64 pixels in total multiplied by 8(colour depth): 64 x 8 = **512

Answer:** Image 1 has a file size of **512 bits**

**Image 2 calculation:** 

16 pixel by 16 pixels: 16 x 16 = 256

256 pixels x 8 bit colour depth: 256 x 8 = **2048**

**Answer:** Image 2 has a file size of **2048 bits**

In practise images are much larges and the pixel density is much greater than the two example above.

IMAGE 3: Dimensions 1600 pixels x 1200 pixels : Bit Depth 24

Follow the same steps to calculate the file size of image 3, this time convert the file size from bits too Megabytes.

**Step 1:** Multiply the number of horizontal pixels by the number of vertical pixels: 1600 x 1200 = 1920000 pixels

**Step 2:** Multiply the total pixels used by the colour/bit depth: 1920000 x 24 = **46080000 bits

**Step 3:** Divide the answer from step 2 by 8 to give the number of bytes used: 46080000 / 8 = 5760000 bytes

**Step 4:** Divide the number of bytes used by 1024 to give the value in Kilobytes: 5760000 / 1024 **= 5625 Kilobytes**

**Step 5:** Divide the number of kilobytes used by 1024 to give the value in Megabytes: 5625 / 1024 = 5.4 Megabytes

The original image 3 has a file size of 5.2Mb, this value excludes any metadata storage used and was the file size before being compressed for use over the internet



**QUESTIONS**

1: An image has the following properties:

- Dimensions 1024 pixels x 575 pixels
- Bit Depth 24

Calculate the image size, show your workings at each stage and display the result in Mb.

2: An image has the following properties:

- Dimensions 12 inch x 11 inch
- Bit Depth 16
- 72 pixels per inch

Calculate the image size, show your workings at each stage and display the result in Mb.

3: Besides the size and bit depth of an image, what else could have an impact on the total file size?

4:Give two situation where reducing the file size of an image is needed, explain the impact of doing this.
